# Heart-Stroke-Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. 
## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and classify whether an individual has heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).
## Features
The dataset consists of 303 rows and 14 columns. Each row represents a patient, and the columns represent various medical attributes.
- `age`: Age of the patient.
- `sex`: Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female).
- `cp`: Chest pain type (0-3).
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl).
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = True; 0 = False).
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2).
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved.
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes; 0 = No).
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2).
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
- `thal`: Thalassemia (1-3).
- `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = Disease; 0 = No Disease).
